## Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs. Static Site Generation (SSG)

**Involved Pages**: pages/users.js

To illustrate the difference between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), let's use an example of a simple blog website. In both cases, we'll assume we have a list of blog posts fetched from an API.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

1. **User Request**: A user requests a specific blog post, e.g., "example.com/blog/my-post."

2. **Server Processing (SSR)**:

   - The server receives the request and knows it needs to render the "my-post" page.
   - It fetches the data for this specific blog post from the API.
   - It renders the HTML for this blog post using a template that includes the fetched data.
   - The server sends the fully rendered HTML page for "my-post" to the user's browser as a response.

3. **Browser Rendering (SSR)**:

   - The user's browser receives the complete HTML page for "my-post."
   - It begins rendering the page immediately.
   - If there's any client-side interactivity (e.g., comments section), the JavaScript code for that functionality is downloaded and executed.

4. **Client Hydration (Optional, but common)**:
   - Once the JavaScript code is executed, it can take over to provide dynamic functionality, such as handling user interactions without full page reloads.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

1. **Build Process (SSG)**:

   - In the development environment, the SSG tool (e.g., Next.js or Gatsby) fetches all the blog posts from the API.
   - It generates static HTML pages for each blog post and stores them as individual files.
   - The generated HTML files are ready to be deployed.

2. **Deployment (SSG)**:

   - The generated static HTML files, including "my-post.html," are deployed to a web server or hosting service.

3. **User Request**:

   - When a user requests "example.com/blog/my-post," the server simply serves the pre-generated "my-post.html" file as a response.

4. **Browser Rendering (SSG)**:
   - The user's browser receives the pre-rendered HTML page for "my-post."
   - It immediately starts rendering the page.
   - There's usually minimal JavaScript required for basic interactivity, such as handling comments, but the core content is already present in the HTML.

### Comparison

- In SSR, the server dynamically renders each page upon user request, which can be slower for the first user but allows for highly dynamic and real-time content.
- In SSG, pages are pre-rendered during the build process and served as static files, resulting in faster initial page loads and better SEO. However, it may require rebuilding the site to update content.

Your choice between SSR and SSG depends on your project's requirements. SSR is suitable for dynamic or frequently updated content, while SSG is ideal for content that doesn't change often and prioritizes performance and SEO. In some cases, a hybrid approach may also be used to combine the benefits of both.
