**Involved Pages**: pages/posts/index.js, pages/posts/[postId].js

In Next.js, the `fallback` option in the `getStaticPaths` function determines what happens when a user tries to access a page with a path that doesn't have a corresponding pre-generated HTML file during the build process. It controls how Next.js handles paths that are not available at build time.

1. **`fallback: false`**:

   - When `fallback` is set to `false`, Next.js will only serve pages for paths that have been pre-generated during the build process. If a user requests a path that doesn't have a corresponding HTML file at build time, Next.js will return a 404 error.

   This behavior is suitable for scenarios where you have a known set of paths that you want to statically generate during the build, and you don't expect new paths to be created dynamically.

2. **`fallback: true`**:

   When `fallback` is set to `true`, it means that Next.js will attempt to serve the page for any path requested, even if it hasn't been pre-generated at build time. If a user requests a path that doesn't have a pre-generated HTML file, Next.js will do the following:

   - The page will be built on-demand (server-side rendering) when the user accesses it for the first time after the initial build. During this process, the server will render the page and generate an HTML file for the requested path.

   - Once the page is built and the HTML file is generated, subsequent requests to the same path will serve the pre-generated HTML file, just like any other statically generated page.

   This behavior is useful for scenarios where you have a large number of dynamic paths, and you don't want to generate all of them at build time. It can be resource-intensive, especially for frequently accessed paths.

In summary, setting `fallback: true` allows Next.js to dynamically generate pages for paths that weren't pre-generated during the build, while `fallback: false` restricts page serving to only those paths that were pre-generated, returning a 404 error for unknown paths. The choice between the two depends on your specific use case and how you want to handle dynamic paths in your Next.js application.
